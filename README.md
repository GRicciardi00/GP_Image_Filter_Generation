## ABOUT IT
## HOW TO USE
The dataset folder contains all the images used for training and testing and the various algorithms used for preliminary operations on them.
For the training run the file 'GP_training.py' and follow the guide on the terminal, then you can run the test with the filters obtained by modifying the file 'GP_test.py' by setting the paths of the necessary _best.pkl files.
The ''image_processing.py'' file uses openCV to edit images with common methods of edge detection and denoise.
The 'results' folder has the algorithm used to evaluate the results obtained.
